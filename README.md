# Semantic Segmentation

### Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. Project: Vehicle Detection and Tracking

This Project is the twelfth task of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program. The main goal of the project is to train an artificial neural network for semantic segmentation of a video from a front-facing camera on a car in order to mark road pixels using Tensorflow.
